# Publish Cycling Power of Kettler Racer 9 over BLE
The Kettler Racer 9 is an ergometer with USB and Bluetooth interface. Unfortunately it lacks Bluetooth Smart support and therefore can not be easily integrated/used together with the Zwift App

In order to be able to use Kettler Racer 9 Ergometer on Zwift the instantaneous power value is published over Bluetooth Smart Characteristic "Cycling Power Measuerment (0x2A63) of the BLE Service Cycling Power Serivce 0x1818.  

## Swift Linux on Raspberri Pi
Inspired by the great work of (360manu|https://github.com/360manu) and his 
great work published in (kettlerUSB2BLE|https://github.com/360manu/kettlerUSB2BLE). However, I wanted to rewrite the functionality using Swift language on Linux. Again, there has been great work already done by the community, namely (PureSwift|https://github.com/PureSwift)
