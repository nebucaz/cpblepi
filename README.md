# Publish Cycling Power of Kettler Racer 9 over BLE
The Kettler Racer 9 is an ergometer with USB and Bluetooth interface. Unfortunately it lacks Bluetooth Smart support and therefore can not be easily integrated/used together with the Zwift App

In order to be able to use Kettler Racer 9 Ergometer on Zwift the instantaneous power value is published over Bluetooth Smart Characteristic "Cycling Power Measuerment [0x2A63](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Sitecore-Media-Library/Gatt/Xml/Characteristics/org.bluetooth.characteristic.cycling_power_measurement.xml) of the BLE Service Cycling Power Serivce [0x1818](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Sitecore-Media-Library/Gatt/Xml/Services/org.bluetooth.service.cycling_power.xml).  

## Swift Linux on Raspberri Pi
Inspired by the great work of [360manu](https://github.com/360manu) and his 
great work published in [kettlerUSB2BLE](https://github.com/360manu/kettlerUSB2BLE). However, I wanted to rewrite the functionality using Swift language on Linux. Again, there has been great work already done by the community, namely [PureSwift](https://github.com/PureSwift)
